MediaManager
============
The MediaManager app is meant to be a nice way to view information about movies / TV shows straight from your PC. It was started as a small personal tutorial for using theTVDB API and some concepts of Microsoft's WPF technology, but evolved to something pretty enough to be presented in GitHub for all to see.

If you enjoy this, you're more than welcome to contibute / fork it.
